        <h1>Indian Agriculture (1950-1990)</h1>

        <h2>1. Pre-Green Revolution Period (1950-1965)</h2>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Low Productivity & Traditional Methods:</strong> Agriculture was largely dependent on rainfall, and traditional farming methods were prevalent.
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Food Shortages & Dependence on Imports:</strong> India faced severe food shortages and relied on imports, mainly from the U.S. under the PL-480 program.
        </div>

        <h3>Land Reforms:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Abolition of Zamindari system</li>
            <li>Tenancy reforms</li>
            <li>Land ceiling acts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, implementation was weak in many regions.</p>

        <h3>Community Development Programs (CDP) & Five-Year Plans:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>First Five-Year Plan (1951-56):</strong> Focused on agriculture and irrigation.</li>
            <li>Introduction of cooperative farming and Integrated Rural Development programs.</li>
            <li>Promotion of improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, and irrigation facilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Institutional Support:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Reserve Bank of India (RBI) played a key role in financing agriculture.</li>
            <li>NABARD (established later in 1982) also supported agricultural development.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Post-Green Revolution Period (1965-1990)</h2>

        <h3>Green Revolution (1965-1985):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Introduction of <strong>High Yielding Variety (HYV) seeds</strong>, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and modern irrigation techniques.</li>
            <li>Focused on wheat and rice production, especially in Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh.</li>
            <li>Significant increase in food grain production, reducing India's dependence on imports.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Government Initiatives:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Minimum Support Price (MSP):</strong> Ensured stable income for farmers.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Distribution System (PDS):</strong> Provided food security.</li>
            <li><strong>Irrigation Projects:</strong> Expansion of canal irrigation and construction of major dams like Bhakra Nangal.</li>
            <li><strong>Agricultural Research & Institutions:</strong> Establishment of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and state agricultural universities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact of Green Revolution:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Positive:</strong> Increased food grain production, self-sufficiency, rural employment.</li>
            <li><strong>Negative:</strong> Regional disparities, soil degradation, water depletion, and excessive use of chemicals leading to environmental concerns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Between 1950-1990, Indian agriculture transformed from a subsistence-based economy to a more productive and semi-commercialized sector. While the Green Revolution helped in achieving food security, it also created new challenges like environmental degradation and unequal benefits among farmers.</p>

        <h2>ðŸ“Œ Introduction</h2>
        <p>India gained independence on **August 15, 1947**. The government chose a **mixed economy** to balance **public sector control** with **private sector participation**.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>ðŸ“Œ Five-Year Plans (1951 Onwards)</h2>

    <h3>2. Post-Green Revolution Period (1965-1990)</h3>
    <p><strong>Green Revolution (1965-1985):</strong> HYV seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and modern irrigation increased wheat and rice production, reducing import dependence.</p>
    <p><strong>Government Initiatives:</strong> MSP ensured farmer income stability, PDS provided food security, and major irrigation projects like Bhakra Nangal were launched.</p>
    <p><strong>Agricultural Research:</strong> ICAR and agricultural universities boosted research.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Increased food production, self-sufficiency, and employment. However, regional disparities, soil degradation, and excessive chemical use led to environmental concerns.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Between 1950-1990, Indian agriculture transformed into a more productive sector. The Green Revolution improved food security but introduced environmental and social challenges.</p>

    <h2>Industrial Sector in India (1950-1990)</h2>

    <h3>1. Nehruvian Industrialization (1950-1965)</h3>
    <p><strong>State-led Industrialization:</strong> Government played a key role under a socialist model.</p>
    <p><strong>Five-Year Plans:</strong> The Second Five-Year Plan (1956-61) emphasized heavy industries (steel, coal, machinery).</p>
    <p><strong>Industrial Policy Resolution, 1956:</strong> Industries were divided into state-owned, joint sector, and private sector.</p>
    <p><strong>Foreign Exchange Control:</strong> Import restrictions promoted indigenous industries (Import Substitution Industrialization).</p>
    
    <h3>2. License Raj & State Control (1965-1980)</h3>
    <p><strong>License-Permit Raj:</strong> Businesses needed government approval for industrial activities.</p>
    <p><strong>Public Sector Expansion:</strong> Government-controlled major industries like banking, oil, and transport.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Public sector growth but inefficiency, corruption, and low private sector productivity.</p>

    <h3>3. Liberalization Attempts (1980-1990)</h3>
    <p><strong>Economic Crisis & Fiscal Deficit:</strong> Public sector inefficiencies and government overspending created fiscal deficits.</p>
    <p><strong>New Industrial Policy (1985):</strong> Encouraged private participation and modernization.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Growth in consumer goods and early signs of liberalization, but heavy regulations persisted.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>From 1950-1990, industrial policies were state-controlled, limiting private growth. Early liberalization in the 1980s set the stage for the 1991 reforms.</p>

    <h2>1991 Economic Crisis & LPG Reforms</h2>

    <h3>Reasons for Economic Crisis</h3>

        <li><strong>Balance of Payments Crisis:</strong> Forex reserves dropped below $1 billion, and India faced trade deficits.</li>
        <li><strong>High Fiscal Deficit:</strong> Government borrowing led to an 8.4% fiscal deficit.</li>
        <li><strong>Rising Inflation:</strong> Inflation soared over 13%, affecting essentials.</li>

    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Increased competition, private sector growth, and foreign investments.</p>

    <h3>2. Privatization</h3>
    <p><strong>Key Reforms:</strong> Disinvestment of PSUs, increased private sector participation, subsidy reductions.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Higher efficiency, reduced government burden, but job losses in PSUs.</p>

    <p><strong>Key Reforms:</strong> Trade policy changes, FDI inflows, WTO membership (1995).</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Economic growth, IT sector boom, and better product quality.</p>

    <h3>Overall Impact</h3>
