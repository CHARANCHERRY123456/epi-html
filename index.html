        <h1>Indian Agriculture (1950-1990)</h1>

        <h2>1. Pre-Green Revolution Period (1950-1965)</h2>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Low Productivity & Traditional Methods:</strong> Agriculture was largely dependent on rainfall, and traditional farming methods were prevalent.
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Food Shortages & Dependence on Imports:</strong> India faced severe food shortages and relied on imports, mainly from the U.S. under the PL-480 program.

            <li>Promotion of improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, and irrigation facilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Institutional Support:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Reserve Bank of India (RBI) played a key role in financing agriculture.</li>
            <li>NABARD (established later in 1982) also supported agricultural development.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Post-Green Revolution Period (1965-1990)</h2>

        <h3>Green Revolution (1965-1985):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Introduction of <strong>High Yielding Variety (HYV) seeds</strong>, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and modern irrigation techniques.</li>
            <li>Focused on wheat and rice production, especially in Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh.</li>
            <li>Significant increase in food grain production, reducing India's dependence on imports.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Government Initiatives:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Minimum Support Price (MSP):</strong> Ensured stable income for farmers.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Distribution System (PDS):</strong> Provided food security.</li>
            <li><strong>Irrigation Projects:</strong> Expansion of canal irrigation and construction of major dams like Bhakra Nangal.</li>
            <li><strong>Agricultural Research & Institutions:</strong> Establishment of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and state agricultural universities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact of Green Revolution:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Positive:</strong> Increased food grain production, self-sufficiency, rural employment.</li>
            <li><strong>Negative:</strong> Regional disparities, soil degradation, water depletion, and excessive use of chemicals leading to environmental concerns.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Between 1950-1990, Indian agriculture transformed from a subsistence-based economy to a more productive and semi-commercialized sector. While the Green Revolution helped in achieving food security, it also created new challenges like environmental degradation and unequal benefits among farmers.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #666;">Liberalisation, Privatisation, and Globalisation – An Appraisal</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Presented by: [Your Name]</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>India followed a mixed economy post-independence. While there was growth in savings, industrial output, and agriculture, stagnation persisted. The 1991 Balance of Payments (BoP) crisis led to major economic reforms aimed at improving efficiency and integrating with the global economy.</p>

    <h2>Background of 1991 Economic Crisis</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>High fiscal deficit & borrowing.</li>
        <li>Low foreign exchange reserves.</li>
        <li>Rising inflation & import dependence.</li>
        <li>Inefficient public sector enterprises.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The IMF & World Bank provided a $7B loan, conditional on economic reforms.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of Economic Reforms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stabilisation Measures:</strong> Short-term policies to control BoP crisis and inflation.</li>
        <li><strong>Structural Reforms:</strong> Long-term policies for efficiency & competitiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Liberalisation, Privatisation, and Globalisation (LPG).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Liberalisation – Deregulation of the Economy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Abolished Industrial Licensing (except hazardous industries).</li>
        <li>Financial Sector Reforms:
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced RBI control; allowed private & foreign banks.</li>
                <li>Increased foreign investment limits (up to 74%).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tax Reforms: Introduced GST in 2017.</li>
        <li>Foreign Exchange Reforms: Market-driven exchange rates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Privatisation – Reducing Government Role</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Methods of Privatisation:
            <ul>
                <li>Disinvestment (selling PSE shares).</li>
                <li>Private participation in telecom & aviation.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Navratna, Miniratna, Maharatna Status for autonomy.</li>
        <li><strong>Criticism:</strong> Selling government assets at undervalued prices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Globalisation – Integration with the World Economy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduced trade barriers & tariffs.</li>
        <li>Encouraged FDI and foreign institutional investments (FII).</li>
        <li>Outsourcing boom in IT, BPO & services sector.</li>
        <li>Joined WTO (1995) for global trade access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact of Economic Reforms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Positive Effects:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased GDP growth (5.6% in 1980-91 to 8.2% in 2007-12).</li>
                <li>Rise in foreign exchange reserves ($6B in 1991 to $413B in 2018-19).</li>
                <li>IT & service sector boom.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Challenges:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Agriculture & industry lagged behind.</li>
                <li>Jobless growth – unemployment not addressed.</li>
                <li>Public sector enterprises declined.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Challenges Post-Reforms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Agriculture: Low public investment & subsidy cuts.</li>
        <li>Industry: Competition from imports, low infrastructure investment.</li>
        <li>Disinvestment Issues: Funds used for fiscal deficit instead of development.</li>
        <li>WTO Challenges: Developed nations protect their industries while pressuring India to open markets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Economic reforms boosted growth but failed to solve employment & rural sector issues.</p>
    <h3>Way Forward:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Strengthen agriculture & manufacturing.</li>
        <li>Invest in infrastructure & social sectors.</li>
        <li>Ensure inclusive growth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Agriculture Sector in India (1950-1990)</h2>

    <h3>1. Pre-Green Revolution Period (1950-1965)</h3>
    <p><strong>Low Productivity & Traditional Methods:</strong> Agriculture relied heavily on rainfall, and traditional farming methods were prevalent.</p>
    <p><strong>Food Shortages & Dependence on Imports:</strong> Severe food shortages led to reliance on imports, mainly under the PL-480 program.</p>
    <p><strong>Land Reforms:</strong> The government introduced land reforms, but weak implementation limited success.</p>
    <p><strong>Community Development & Five-Year Plans:</strong> The First Five-Year Plan (1951-56) focused on irrigation, cooperative farming, and rural development.</p>
    <p><strong>Institutional Support:</strong> The RBI and later NABARD (1982) played key roles in financing agriculture.</p>

    <h3>2. Post-Green Revolution Period (1965-1990)</h3>
    <p><strong>Green Revolution (1965-1985):</strong> HYV seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and modern irrigation increased wheat and rice production, reducing import dependence.</p>
    <p><strong>Government Initiatives:</strong> MSP ensured farmer income stability, PDS provided food security, and major irrigation projects like Bhakra Nangal were launched.</p>
    <p><strong>Agricultural Research:</strong> ICAR and agricultural universities boosted research.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Increased food production, self-sufficiency, and employment. However, regional disparities, soil degradation, and excessive chemical use led to environmental concerns.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Between 1950-1990, Indian agriculture transformed into a more productive sector. The Green Revolution improved food security but introduced environmental and social challenges.</p>

    <h2>Industrial Sector in India (1950-1990)</h2>

    <h3>1. Nehruvian Industrialization (1950-1965)</h3>
    <p><strong>State-led Industrialization:</strong> Government played a key role under a socialist model.</p>
    <p><strong>Five-Year Plans:</strong> The Second Five-Year Plan (1956-61) emphasized heavy industries (steel, coal, machinery).</p>
    <p><strong>Industrial Policy Resolution, 1956:</strong> Industries were divided into state-owned, joint sector, and private sector.</p>
    <p><strong>Foreign Exchange Control:</strong> Import restrictions promoted indigenous industries (Import Substitution Industrialization).</p>
    
    <h3>2. License Raj & State Control (1965-1980)</h3>
    <p><strong>License-Permit Raj:</strong> Businesses needed government approval for industrial activities.</p>
    <p><strong>Public Sector Expansion:</strong> Government-controlled major industries like banking, oil, and transport.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Public sector growth but inefficiency, corruption, and low private sector productivity.</p>

    <h3>3. Liberalization Attempts (1980-1990)</h3>
    <p><strong>Economic Crisis & Fiscal Deficit:</strong> Public sector inefficiencies and government overspending created fiscal deficits.</p>
    <p><strong>New Industrial Policy (1985):</strong> Encouraged private participation and modernization.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Growth in consumer goods and early signs of liberalization, but heavy regulations persisted.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>From 1950-1990, industrial policies were state-controlled, limiting private growth. Early liberalization in the 1980s set the stage for the 1991 reforms.</p>

    <h2>1991 Economic Crisis & LPG Reforms</h2>

    <h3>Reasons for Economic Crisis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Balance of Payments Crisis:</strong> Forex reserves dropped below $1 billion, and India faced trade deficits.</li>
        <li><strong>High Fiscal Deficit:</strong> Government borrowing led to an 8.4% fiscal deficit.</li>
        <li><strong>Rising Inflation:</strong> Inflation soared over 13%, affecting essentials.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Sector Inefficiency:</strong> Loss-making PSUs burdened the economy.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Pressure:</strong> IMF bailout conditions forced India to open its economy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1. Liberalization</h3>
    <p><strong>Key Reforms:</strong> End of License Raj, FDI encouragement, import tariff reduction.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Increased competition, private sector growth, and foreign investments.</p>

    <h3>2. Privatization</h3>
    <p><strong>Key Reforms:</strong> Disinvestment of PSUs, increased private sector participation, subsidy reductions.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Higher efficiency, reduced government burden, but job losses in PSUs.</p>

    <h3>3. Globalization</h3>
    <p><strong>Key Reforms:</strong> Trade policy changes, FDI inflows, WTO membership (1995).</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Economic growth, IT sector boom, and better product quality.</p>

    <h3>Overall Impact</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Positive:</strong> Higher GDP, IT boom, job creation, infrastructure growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Negative:</strong> Income inequality, PSU job losses, inflation, environmental issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The 1991 LPG reforms transformed India into a global economic power, but challenges like inequality and environmental concerns remain.</p>
